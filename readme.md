# 🕹️ Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple and interactive **Tic Tac Toe** game built using **React.js**. This project was created to practice basic React concepts like components, state management, conditional rendering, and user interaction.

## 🚀 Features

- Classic 3x3 grid-based Tic Tac Toe gameplay
- Two-player mode (X and O)
- Game winner detection
- Game reset functionality
- Responsive and clean UI using **Tailwind CSS** (optional)
- Component-based structure for easy maintenance and extension

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React.js** – Frontend library
- **JavaScript** – Logic and interactivity
- **Tailwind CSS** _(optional)_ – Styling
- **Vite** or **Create React App** – Project scaffolding

## 🧠 How It Works

- The board is made up of 9 `Square` components.
- The game state is managed in the `Board` component using React’s `useState`.
- The app tracks turns and checks for a winner after each move.
- A message shows the current player or winner.
- A **Reset** button lets users start a new game.
